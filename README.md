# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
# PROJECT OVERVIEW
In the realm of data science and machine learning, the classification of Iris flowers is a fundamental task that demonstrates the power of predictive modeling. Iris Flower Classification utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. By analyzing petal and sepal measurements, this project aims to build a model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower. This classification task not only serves as an educational tool but also provides insights into the application of various machine learning techniques.

# DATASET DESCRIPTION
The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers and their corresponding species. Here is a description of each column:

Id: Unique identifier for each row (integer).

SepalLengthCm: Sepal length in centimeters (float).

SepalWidthCm: Sepal width in centimeters (float).

PetalLengthCm: Petal length in centimeters (float).

PetalWidthCm: Petal width in centimeters (float).

Species: Species of the iris flower (object).

# CLASSIFICATION OBJECTIVE

The classification aims to:

1. Understand the distribution and relationships between different features of iris flowers.
2. Clean and preprocess the data for machine learning.
3. Implement and evaluate classification models to predict the species of iris flowers.
4. Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the model performance.

# TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED

1. Programming Language: Python
2. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
3. Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

# FILES INCLUDED

1. Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code.
2. Iris.csv: CSV file containing the Iris dataset used for classification.
3. README.md: Project overview, dataset description, classification objectives, tools and technologies, files included and conclusion.

# CONCLUSION

The Logistic Regression model effectively classifies iris flowers into their respective species with high accuracy, demonstrating the successful application of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning techniques. The dataset, balanced and clean, reveals that the species Setosa is easily distinguishable based on petal and sepal measurements. This project confirms the reliability of Logistic Regression for iris species classification, underscoring the power of machine learning in biological classification tasks.
